Sure, here's a README for your Python password generator script:

# Python Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user input. The generated password includes a mix of numbers, alphabets, and special characters.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the desired size of the password.
3. Next, specify the number of numeric characters you want in the password.
4. Then, specify the number of alphabetic characters you want in the password.
5. Finally, specify the number of special characters you want in the password.

The script will then generate a random password that meets your specifications and print it out.

## Requirements

This script requires Python's built-in `random` and `itertools` modules. Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run this script.

Please note that this script does not guarantee the strength or security of the generated password. Always follow best practices for creating and storing passwords.
